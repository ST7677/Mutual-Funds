# Mutual-Funds

The objective of this project is to extract latest data on Indian Mutual Funds from public sources for analysis and recommend top 5 funds as good investment options in different categories for further detailed analysis. As part of this I  also explore how different factors influence the performance for different investment horizons. 

## Motivation

Mutual fund are professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. These investors may be retail or institutional in nature.
Mutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in individual securities. The primary advantages of mutual funds are that they provide economies of scale, a higher level of diversification, they provide liquidity, and they are managed by professional investors. On the negative side, investors in a mutual fund must pay various fees and expenses.

This project was taken up as part of UDACITY Data Science Nano Degree program Capstone project.
